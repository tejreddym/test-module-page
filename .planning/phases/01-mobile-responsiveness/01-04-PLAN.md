# Plan: Mobile Responsive - Study Planner

**Requirement ID:** REQ-4-MOBILE
**Target Path:** `/study-planner`

## Context
The Study Planner is a core feature that requires interaction. Its layout (likely a calendar, timeline, or list of subjects) needs to be optimized for touch and narrow screens.

<tasks>
  <task>
    <description>Review `src/StudyPlanner.jsx` to locate structural components. Change horizontal layouts (e.g., subject list next to calendar) to a stacked vertical layout using Tailwind's `flex-col md:flex-row` or equivalent grid classes.</description>
    <expected_outcome>Main sections stack logically on mobile.</expected_outcome>
  </task>
  <task>
    <description>For any calendar or timeline views, ensure days/events wrap or scroll intentionally (e.g., standardizing touch targets constraint, ensuring text is readable).</description>
    <expected_outcome>Users can easily tap specific days/tasks without missing.</expected_outcome>
  </task>
  <task>
    <description>Verify that form inputs (like setting goals or adding tasks) span the full width of the mobile viewport and are easily selectable without triggering OS zoom.</description>
    <expected_outcome>Input forms are mobile-friendly.</expected_outcome>
  </task>
</tasks>

## Verification
- **must_haves:** The `/study-planner` route allows a user to view their plan and interact with tasks on a 375px wide viewport without horizontal layout breakage.
