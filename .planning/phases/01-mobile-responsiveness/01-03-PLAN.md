# Plan: Mobile Responsive - Test Analytics

**Requirement ID:** REQ-3-MOBILE
**Target Path:** `/test-analytics`

## Context
The Test Analytics page likely contains large charts (Chart.js), tables, and grid layouts that do not scale well proportionally on mobile. 

<tasks>
  <task>
    <description>Identify Chart.js canvases in `src/TestAnalytics.jsx` and ensure their parent containers have `w-full` and appropriate `min-h-[Xpx]` constraints so they resize properly on smaller screens without collapsing.</description>
    <expected_outcome>Charts are legible and scale horizontally rather than overflowing.</expected_outcome>
  </task>
  <task>
    <description>Convert any multi-column stat grids (e.g., `grid-cols-4`) to a single column (`grid-cols-1`) or a wrapping flex layout on screens `< 768px`.</description>
    <expected_outcome>Score breakdowns and performance metrics stack vertically on mobile.</expected_outcome>
  </task>
  <task>
    <description>Ensure the header/navigation elements specific to the analytics view do not overlap with content.</description>
    <expected_outcome>The page structure is logical and flows vertically.</expected_outcome>
  </task>
</tasks>

## Verification
- **must_haves:** The `/test-analytics` route must present readable charts and statistics without forcing the user to zoom out or scroll horizontally on a 375px display.
