# Plan: Mobile Responsive - Mock Exam Interface

**Requirement ID:** REQ-2-MOBILE
**Target Path:** `/mock-exam`

## Context
The Mock Exam interface consists of multiple panels (question area, navigation grid, timer). This complex layout is often unusable on mobile devices without specific adaptations.

<tasks>
  <task>
    <description>Analyze `src/MockExamInterface.jsx` and its associated CSS for rigid width constraints or un-collapsible sidebars.</description>
    <expected_outcome>Identified the sidebar/navigation grid and the main question area as primary targets for responsive design.</expected_outcome>
  </task>
  <task>
    <description>Implement a collapsible or off-canvas approach for the question navigation grid on mobile devices. Consider hiding it behind a "View Questions" button or moving it below the current question.</description>
    <expected_outcome>The question text area dominates the screen on mobile; the navigation grid is accessible but not obtrusive.</expected_outcome>
  </task>
  <task>
    <description>Reposition the timer and action buttons (Next, Previous, Submit) to be consistently visible and easily tappable on small screens.</description>
    <expected_outcome>Test controls remain accessible without excessive scrolling.</expected_outcome>
  </task>
</tasks>

## Verification
- **must_haves:** The `/mock-exam` route must allow a user to read a question, select an answer, and navigate between questions on a mobile device without layout breakage.
