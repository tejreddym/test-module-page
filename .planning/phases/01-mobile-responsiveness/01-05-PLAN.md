# Plan: Mobile Responsive - User Profile

**Requirement ID:** REQ-5-MOBILE
**Target Path:** `/user-profile`

## Context
The User Profile page normally contains personal details, subscription plans, past performance, and settings. These elements often sit side-by-side on desktop but must stack elegantly on mobile.

<tasks>
  <task>
    <description>Inspect `src/UserProfile.jsx` and its CSS (e.g., `UserProfile.css`). Convert grid-based split views (like a left sidebar with profile info and a main content area) into a single-column layout on small screens.</description>
    <expected_outcome>Profile picture and basic info sit above the detailed content tabs or panels on mobile.</expected_outcome>
  </task>
  <task>
    <description>Ensure any tabular data (like past test attempts) uses responsive tables (e.g., horizontal scrolling container) or is converted to a card-based layout for mobile screens.</description>
    <expected_outcome>Tables do not break the page width; data remains readable.</expected_outcome>
  </task>
  <task>
    <description>Make sure action buttons (Edit Profile, Save Changes, Logout) are full-width or appropriately sized for fat fingers on mobile.</description>
    <expected_outcome>Touch targets for vital actions are prominent and easy to hit.</expected_outcome>
  </task>
</tasks>

## Verification
- **must_haves:** The `/user-profile` route displays user information clearly without horizontal scrolling on a 375px viewport. All buttons are tappable.
