## 1. Goal
Refactor exam lists into a data-driven architecture to improve maintainability and UI consistency across all streams.

- [ ] Verify functionality across all streams.

## 3. Verification Criteria
- [ ] All 6 stream list pages render correctly with their specific data.
- [ ] Breadcrumbs correctly reflect the current stream.
- [ ] "Back to Streams" navigation works from every page.
