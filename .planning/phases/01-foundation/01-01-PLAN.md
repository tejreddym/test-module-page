# Phase 1: Foundation & Core Setup

This plan establishes the core architecture, routing structure, and essential reusable components for the Exam Prep Platform, based on the `SPEC.md`.

## 1. Goal
Set up the foundational routing structure for all stream pages and exams, ensure consistent global styling, and create the base layout components that will be used across the application.

## 2. Tasks

### Task 1: Navigation & Routing Polish
- Review and refine `src/App.jsx` to ensure all 10+ routes (streams, setup, finalize) are correctly configured.
- Implement a 404/Not Found fallback route.
- Ensure the `<Header />` component is fully responsive and contains navigation links to key areas (Home, Profile, etc.).

### Task 2: Standardize Global UI Components
- Extract commonly used UI elements (e.g., the `AnimatedCounter`, Glassmorphic Cards, gradient badges) from `ExamPrepLibrary.jsx` into a reusable `src/components/ui/` directory.
- Standardize the color palette in `index.css` using CSS variables to make theme switching (Dark/Light mode) completely robust. 

### Task 3: Streamline the "Select Stream" Flow
- Refactor `src/SelectStream.jsx` and `src/SelectStream.css` to use the newly created reusable UI components.
- Ensure smooth `framer-motion` transitions when navigating from the Home page to the Stream selection.

## 3. Verification Criteria
- [ ] Application compiles without errors (`npm run build`).
- [ ] Navigating between `/`, `/select-stream`, and any specific stream page does not cause full page reloads (client-side routing works).
- [ ] Reusable components (e.g., Cards, Buttons) render correctly on both `/` and `/select-stream` with consistent styling.
- [ ] Dark mode toggle (if applicable) appropriately switches CSS variables globally.

## 4. Next Steps
Once Phase 1 is executed and verified, we can move on to Phase 2: Domain-Specific Exam List Implementation (Engineering, Medical, Commerce, etc.).
